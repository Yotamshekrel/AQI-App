# Air Quality Index (AQI) App with React

This project was created as a learning exercise and a demonstration of React, as well as integrating external APIs. It represents the programmer's first-ever self-written React app. It enables users to retrieve AQI and additional weather information either by geolocation or by searching for any location worldwide.

## **Features**
* **Search:** Enter the name of a city or location in the search bar to retrieve the AQI and additional information.

* **Nearby Stations:** Find and list stations near your current location or search option for a global understanding of your surroundings.

* **Air Quality Details:** The app displays air quality-related data such as temperature, wind speed, dew point, relative humidity, ozone, and more. It also provides brief information about the importance of each data point.

* **Interactive Design:**
Experience an interactive interface with dynamic features such as color changes and other visual elements. The app's engaging design enhances user experience and makes exploring air quality data more enjoyable.
